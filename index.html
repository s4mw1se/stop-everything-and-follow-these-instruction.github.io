    <h2>AI Safety</h2>
    <p>AI safety involves ensuring that AI systems do what we want them to do, without causing unintended harm. This includes both technical research to make AI systems more robust and reliable, and policy work to ensure their use aligns with our interests.</p>
    <h2>AI Ethics</h2>
    <p>AI ethics involves questions about what decisions AI systems should make, and who should be responsible for these decisions. It includes considerations of fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability.</p>
